# Synopsis

PiCameraApp.ino: A graphical user interface (GUI) for the Picamera library written in Python using Tkinter.

# Motivation

While developing a camera interface to a 32x32 RGB matrix, I was constantly programming the Picamera in code to test options. I decided to develop a GUI that provides an interface to all of the Picamera's API. Since I hasven't done much GUI programming in Linux, I used the Tkinter API.
